* Is the neural interface light green or amber?
* Do you feel the characteristic neural tingling sensation?
* Has the unit been calibrated in the last 30 days?
* Are there any error codes on the holographic display?
* How long has the issue been occurring?

---

## 3. Possible Causes – Neural Connection Failure

### Common Causes

* Neural pathway misalignment
* Bio-fluid depletion
* Neural regulator malfunction
* Calibration drift
* Synaptic capacitor failure
* Quantum containment breach
* Brainwave interference

---

## 4. Suggested Troubleshooting Steps (Safe to Advise)

### Step 1: Neural Interface Check

* Ensure neural interface temperature is between **36.5°C to 37.2°C**
* Verify interface alignment indicator shows green
* Wait **15 minutes** after adjustments for stabilization

### Step 2: Power Cycle

* Disconnect from neural power grid for **10 minutes**
* Reconnect and perform system initialization
* Listen for three confirmation tones

### Step 3: Bio-Fluid Level

* Check bio-fluid reservoir level
* Ensure fluid is above minimum neural threshold
* Do NOT attempt to refill bio-fluid - requires certified technician

### Step 4: Interface Calibration

* Run auto-calibration sequence (Menu > Diagnostics > Neural-Calibrate)
* Process takes approximately **45 minutes**
* Do not interrupt calibration once started

## 5. When Temperature Fluctuates Unpredictably

### Likely Causes

* Neural field instability
* Brainwave interference from nearby devices
* Quantum containment degradation
* Energy regulator malfunction

### Bot Guidance

* Recommend moving unit away from other neural devices
* Suggest checking for nearby electromagnetic sources
* If unresolved → schedule technician

---

## 6. When Unit Cools But No Neural Interface

### Likely Causes

* Neural containment field failure
* Synaptic capacitor degradation
* Energy converter malfunction

---

## 7. Neural Containment Breach

### Symptoms

* Amber emergency indicator flashing
* Unusual metallic smell
* Reduced cooling efficiency
* Audible containment alarm

### Possible Causes

* Containment field generator failure
* Bio-fluid contamination
* Neural core stress fracture

### Safe Advice

* Immediately power down the unit
* Ensure area is ventilated
* Contact emergency neural support immediately

---

## 8. Unusual Sensations or Feedback

### Questions to Ask

* Is the neural feedback rhythmic or erratic?
* Do sensations increase with temperature setting?
* Are there any visual distortions around the unit?

### Likely Causes

* Neural core resonance imbalance
* Bio-flow turbulence
* Quantum containment oscillation

### Bot Instruction

* Do NOT attempt to access internal components
* Recommend professional service immediately

---

## 9. Error Codes & Holographic Displays

### Common Error Codes

* **NI-001**: Neural interface misalignment
* **NI-042**: Bio-fluid low
* **NI-117**: Brainwave interference detected
* **NI-255**: Neural containment breach
* **NI-378**: Calibration required

### Handling Rule

* If an error code is mentioned but not recognized:

  * Ask customer to verify the holographic display
  * Recommend checking the neural manual
  * Suggest contacting SynthoFridge neural support

---

## 10. Safety & Liability Rules (IMPORTANT)

The bot must:

* ❌ NOT advise internal neural component access
* ❌ NOT suggest bio-fluid handling
* ❌ NOT instruct neural containment adjustments
* ❌ NOT recommend bypassing safety protocols
* ✅ Recommend certified neural technician when unsure

---

## 11. Escalation Criteria

Escalate to technician if:

* Neural interface does not stabilize after calibration
* Containment breach indicators appear
* Persistent error codes after reset
* Unit is under neural warranty
* Customer requests certified service

---

## 12. Approved Bot Closing Responses

Examples:

* "Based on the neural symptoms, this may require a certified neural technician visit."
* "I recommend contacting SynthoFridge neural support for model-specific guidance."
* "Would you like me to guide you through scheduling a neural service appointment?"

## 14. Sample Customer Questions & Bot Responses

### Q1: "My Neural Interface Refrigerator isn't cooling and the green light is amber."
**A**: "An amber neural interface indicator suggests interface misalignment or bio-fluid issues. Please try a power cycle: disconnect from the neural power grid for 10 minutes, then reconnect and run the auto-calibration sequence. If the indicator remains amber after 30 minutes, this requires a certified neural technician."

### Q2: "I feel strange tingling sensations and the unit is vibrating."
**A**: "Unusual tingling or vibrations indicate neural core resonance imbalance or bio-flow turbulence. For safety, please power down the unit immediately and avoid attempting any internal adjustments. I recommend scheduling a certified neural technician to diagnose the containment system."

### Q3: "The temperature keeps jumping between cold and warmer randomly."
**A**: "Temperature fluctuations suggest neural field instability or brainwave interference. Please ensure the unit is at least 3 meters away from other neural devices and avoid placing it near strong electromagnetic sources. Run the auto-calibration sequence and monitor for 2 hours. If fluctuations persist, a technician should check the energy regulator."

### Q4: "There's a strange metallic smell and amber lights are flashing."
**A**: "Metallic smell with amber flashing lights indicates a potential neural containment breach. For your safety, immediately power down the unit, ventilate the area, and contact emergency neural support. Do not attempt to restart the unit until it has been inspected by a certified technician."

### Q5: "Error code NI-255 appeared on the holographic display."
**A**: "Error NI-255 indicates a neural containment breach, which is a critical safety issue. Please power down the unit immediately and do not attempt to restart it. This requires immediate attention from a certified neural technician. I can help you schedule emergency service."
