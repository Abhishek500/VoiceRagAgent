* How long has the issue been occurring?

---

## 3. Possible Causes – Quantum Flux Generation Failure

### Common Causes

* Quantum core misalignment
* Plasma coolant depletion
* Energy field regulator malfunction
* Calibration drift
* Quantum capacitor failure
* Magnetic containment breach
* Subspace interference

---

## 4. Suggested Troubleshooting Steps (Safe to Advise)

### Step 1: Quantum Core Check

* Ensure quantum core temperature is between **-273.14°C to -273.12°C**
* Verify core alignment indicator shows green
* Wait **15 minutes** after adjustments for stabilization

### Step 2: Power Cycle

* Disconnect from quantum power grid for **10 minutes**
* Reconnect and perform system initialization
* Listen for three confirmation beeps

### Step 3: Plasma Coolant Level

* Check plasma coolant reservoir level
* Ensure coolant is above minimum quantum threshold
* Do NOT attempt to refill coolant - requires certified technician

### Step 4: Field Calibration

* Run auto-calibration sequence (Menu > Diagnostics > Auto-Calibrate)
* Process takes approximately **45 minutes**
* Do not interrupt calibration once started

## 5. When Temperature Fluctuates Unpredictably

### Likely Causes

* Quantum field instability
* Subspace interference from nearby devices
* Magnetic containment degradation
* Energy regulator malfunction

### Bot Guidance

* Recommend moving unit away from other quantum devices
* Suggest checking for nearby electromagnetic sources
* If unresolved → schedule technician

---

## 6. When Unit Produces Heat But No Quantum Flux

### Likely Causes

* Plasma containment field failure
* Quantum capacitor degradation
* Energy converter malfunction

---

## 7. Plasma Containment Breach

### Symptoms

* Red emergency indicator flashing
* Unusual ozone smell
* Reduced heating efficiency
* Audible containment alarm

### Possible Causes

* Containment field generator failure
* Plasma coolant contamination
* Quantum core stress fracture

### Safe Advice

* Immediately power down the unit
* Ensure area is ventilated
* Contact emergency quantum support immediately

---

## 8. Unusual Noises or Vibrations

### Questions to Ask

* Is the humming sound rhythmic or erratic?
* Do vibrations increase with temperature setting?
* Are there any visual distortions around the unit?

### Likely Causes

* Quantum core resonance imbalance
* Plasma flow turbulence
* Magnetic containment oscillation

### Bot Instruction

* Do NOT attempt to access internal components
* Recommend professional service immediately

---

## 9. Error Codes & Holographic Displays

### Common Error Codes

* **QF-001**: Quantum core misalignment
* **QF-042**: Plasma coolant low
* **QF-117**: Subspace interference detected

* **QF-378**: Calibration required

### Handling Rule

* If an error code is mentioned but not recognized:

  * Ask customer to verify the holographic display
  * Recommend checking the quantum manual
  * Suggest contacting NexaTherm quantum support

---

## 10. Safety & Liability Rules (IMPORTANT)

The bot must:

* ❌ NOT advise internal quantum component access
* ❌ NOT suggest plasma coolant handling
* ❌ NOT instruct magnetic containment adjustments
* ❌ NOT recommend bypassing safety protocols
* ✅ Recommend certified quantum technician when unsure

---

## 11. Escalation Criteria

Escalate to technician if:

* Quantum flux does not stabilize after calibration
* Containment breach indicators appear
* Persistent error codes after reset
* Unit is under quantum warranty
* Customer requests certified service

---

## 12. Approved Bot Closing Responses

Examples:

* "Based on the quantum symptoms, this may require a certified quantum technician visit."
* "I recommend contacting NexaTherm quantum support for model-specific guidance."
* "Would you like me to guide you through scheduling a quantum service appointment?"

## 14. Sample Customer Questions & Bot Responses

### Q1: "My Quantum Flux Heater isn't producing any heat and the blue light is red."
**A**: "A red quantum core indicator suggests core misalignment or plasma coolant issues. Please try a power cycle: disconnect from the quantum power grid for 10 minutes, then reconnect and run the auto-calibration sequence. If the indicator remains red after 30 minutes, this requires a certified quantum technician."

### Q2: "I hear a loud humming sound and the unit is vibrating."
**A**: "Unusual humming or vibrations indicate quantum core resonance imbalance or plasma flow turbulence. For safety, please power down the unit immediately and avoid attempting any internal adjustments. I recommend scheduling a certified quantum technician to diagnose the magnetic containment system."

### Q3: "The temperature keeps jumping between hot and cold randomly."
**A**: "Temperature fluctuations suggest quantum field instability or subspace interference. Please ensure the unit is at least 3 meters away from other quantum devices and avoid placing it near strong electromagnetic sources. Run the auto-calibration sequence and monitor for 2 hours. If fluctuations persist, a technician should check the energy regulator."

### Q4: "There's a strange ozone smell and red lights are flashing."
**A**: "Ozone smell with red flashing lights indicates a potential plasma containment breach. For your safety, immediately power down the unit, ventilate the area, and contact emergency quantum support. Do not attempt to restart the unit until it has been inspected by a certified technician."

### Q5: "Error code QF-255 appeared on the holographic display."
**A**: "Error QF-255 indicates a magnetic containment breach, which is a critical safety issue. Please power down the unit immediately and do not attempt to restart it. This requires immediate attention from a certified quantum technician. I can help you schedule emergency service."
